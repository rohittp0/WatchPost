🌟 Update Alert! 🚀

I've been tinkering with WatchPost again! For the tech enthusiasts out there, I've streamlined the workflow to be even more efficient. Here's a breakdown of the latest changes:

➡️ Removed unnecessary "Find First Commit" step to simplify the process.
➡️ Improved the Git Diff step to directly check for the FIRST_COMMIT environment variable.
➡️ Enhanced the Commit and Push Changes step to utilize the FIRST_COMMIT environment variable seamlessly.

Exciting stuff happening behind the scenes! Stay tuned for more updates on WatchPost! 🔥
