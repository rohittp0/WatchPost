🚀 Time for another WatchPost update! 🌟

Since the last post, I've been tinkering away and made some exciting changes to our automated LinkedIn post creation tool:

➡️ Removed unnecessary `find-commit` step in the workflow for better efficiency.
➡️ Updated the workflow to directly use the `FIRST_COMMIT` environment variable, streamlining the process.
➡️ Added the `FIRST_COMMIT` environment variable to the `Commit and Push Changes` step for more organized version control.

With these enhancements, WatchPost is now smoother and more efficient in generating LinkedIn posts based on your GitHub activity! 🤖
