🚀 Exciting news everyone! 🌟 I've just kickstarted an awesome project called WebRec where you can do fully local screen recording right in your browser! 🎥 Just hit the "Start Recording" button, do your thing, and download the recording whenever you're ready. How cool is that?! 😎

🛠️ In my initial commit, I've set up the basic structure for the project, including:
➡️ Added an HTML file for the screen recording web app.
➡️ Styled the interface with buttons for starting and stopping the recording, along with a timer to keep track of the recording time.
➡️ Mounted a smooth GitHub link to easily access the project's code.

🔗 Check out the project on GitHub to follow along and stay tuned for more updates and features coming your way! Let's dive into the world of WebRec together! 🌐💻
