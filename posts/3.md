ğŸš€ Exciting update! ğŸŒŸ Since the last post, I've added a new feature to WatchPost - now you can specify which OpenAI model to use for content generation directly in your GitHub Actions secrets. This means you have even more control over the tone and style of the LinkedIn posts WatchPost creates for you! ğŸ¤–

If you're curious to try it out, check out the updated GitHub repo here: https://github.com/rohittp0/WatchPost

Keep an eye out for more enhancements and improvements coming soon! ğŸš€ğŸ’¼
