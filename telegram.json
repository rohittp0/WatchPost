How cool is that?! 😎\n\n🛠️ In my initial commit, I've set up the basic structure for the project, including:\n➡️ Added an HTML file for the screen recording web app.\n➡️ Styled the interface with buttons for starting and stopping the recording, along with a timer to keep track of the recording time.\n➡️ Mounted a smooth GitHub link to easily access the project's code.\n\n🔗 Check out the project on GitHub to follow along and stay tuned for more updates and features coming your way! Let's dive into the world of WebRec together! 🌐💻\n\nGitHub Repo: https://github.com/rohittp0/WebRec", "parse_mode": "Markdown", "reply_markup": {"inline_keyboard": [[{"text": "View on GitHub", "url": "https://github.com/rohittp0/WatchPost/blob/rohittp0/WebRec/posts/1.md"}]]}}
